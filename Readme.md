# openmpSortings

## What is this?

This is a school project by students of PUC-MG.

We were instructed to implement 4 sorting algorithms (Quicksort, Mergesort and 2 others, of our choosing) with parallelization using [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/) and test their efficiency.

## How does it work?

### How to run?

#### Compile and run

Run ```./run.sh``` on the base directory or, run ```./run.sh``` inside the directory of the algorithm you wish to test.

This will compile and run each one and output it's execution time into a log-file called ```output.txt``` inside the algorithm's directory.

#### Clear all log files and binaries

Run ```./clear.sh``` on the base directory.
